As part of the mathematics PhD program at Stony Brook University, graduate students are required to pass seven core classes (Algebra I and II, Real Analysis I and II, Topology/Geometry I and II, and Complex Analysis). Furthermore, students are required to pass a comprehensive qualifying exam based on the syllabi of each of these courses.

To that end, this repository is a compilation of the notes, exercises/problems, and general work I have completed to prepare for these exams. 

As always, the aim is to contain no errors. However, it is possible that an error will appear in one of the subpages. Such errors are completely my fault and responsibility. With that in mind, let's get started!

"If you are receptive and humble, mathematics will lead you by the hand. Again and again, when I have been at a loss how to proceed, I have just had to wait until I have felt the mathematics led me by the hand. It has led me along an unexpected path, a path where new vistas open up, a path leading to new territory" - P.A.M. Dirac

"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show" - B. Russell
